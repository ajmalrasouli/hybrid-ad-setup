# hybrid-ad-setup
This project demonstrates how to set up a **hybrid identity environment** by integrating an on-premises **Active Directory (AD)** with **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** using **Azure AD Connect**. The goal is to enable seamless identity synchronization and Single Sign-On (SSO) between cloud and on-prem environments.
